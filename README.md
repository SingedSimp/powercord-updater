# powercord-updater
Simple windows script to update powercord (https://powercord.dev).

This only works if your installation of powercord is on windows and is in the default location (%userprofile%/powercord), but you can manually change the location in the file yourself.

The code doesn't do anythiong special and is mostly just done to replug without any hassle.
